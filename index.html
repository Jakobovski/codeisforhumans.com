                    About the book
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This book is a compilation of what I have learned from decades of writing software, exploring my
                    cognitive abilities, and working with other humans. It is inspired by years of seeing
                    highly-intelligent engineers obliviously, and repeatedly, making the same mistakes. They did not
                    understand why things kept breaking. They did not understand why code was constantly needing to be
                    re-written, and why changes were so expensive. Despite their intelligence, they were simply unable
                    to build mental models that would help them understand what code is and how it should be written.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This book is an attempted solution that problem. It lays out a framework for understanding what code is and how software should be engineered. How
                    code is a tool meant for human minds and meeting human needs. It teaches how humans can reliably
                    describe computations with a complexity far beyond the capabilities of our limited monkey minds. How
                    code can be made monkey readable and monkey proof. It teaches how to balance concerns, cut the
                    correct corners, defend against entropy, take precautions, reduce complexity, and deal with our
                    cognitive limitations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This book will give tools, language, mental models and principles, which are critical for developing
                    your craft as an engineer. This book will teach you to differentiate and judge, provide you with a
                    language for discussing and thinking about code, and help you determine the best way to meet your
                    and your organizations goals.

                    About the author
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Zohar Jackson has had a unique career in software development. He served as a Software Architect at
                    Mobileye (Israel's largest startup exit) leading a 100+ person engineering team. He has worked on a
                    large variety of software such as self-driving cars, web apps, projects with intelligence agencies,
                    automated trading for financial firms, massive distributed systems, embedded devices and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In his youth Zohar spent time living a forest, starting a commune, making bombs, hacking things he
                    shouldn't have, hitchhiking, and of course writing copious amounts of software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an aspiring generalist both in software and in life Zohar brings in ideas from a variety of
                    fields such as design, cognitive science, and physics.
