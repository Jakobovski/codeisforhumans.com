                    About the book
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This book is a compilation of what I have learned from decades of writing software, exploring my
                    cognitive abilities, and working with other humans. It is inspired by years of seeing
                    highly-intelligent engineers obliviously, and repeatedly, making the same mistakes. They did not
                    understand why things kept breaking. They did not understand why code was constantly needing to be
                    re-written, and why changes were so expensive. Despite their intelligence, they were simply unable
                    to build mental models that would help them understand what code is and how it should be written.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This book is an attempted solution to that problem. It lays out a framework for understanding what
                    code is and how software should be engineered. How
                    code is a tool meant for human minds and meeting human needs. It teaches how humans can reliably
                    describe computations with a complexity far beyond the capabilities of our limited monkey minds. How
                    code can be made monkey readable and monkey proof. It teaches how to balance concerns, cut the
                    correct corners, defend against entropy, take precautions, reduce complexity, and deal with our
                    cognitive limitations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This book will give you the tools, language, mental models, and principles, which are critical for developing
                    your craft as an engineer. This book will teach you to differentiate and judge, provide you with a
                    language for discussing and thinking about code, and help you determine the best way to meet your
                    and your organization's goals.
                </p>
